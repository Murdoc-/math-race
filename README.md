Simple knockout.js / websockets / node.js real-time game

This is a **very simple real-time game** created with node.js, knockout.js and socket.io. 

##Goal 

Try to be faster than the other players in **solving simple mathematical equations**.

Every game has a limited time (defaults to one minute), so hurry up and beat the others.
